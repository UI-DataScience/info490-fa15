In this week, you will again be delving further into Unix and Python. First, you will learn how to view and modify parts of the environment in Unix-like environments, and then learn how to use vim and vi in Unix.  Finally, you will then delve into the wondrous world of lists, dictionaries, strings, and tuples, where you will learn what these things are, when to use them, how they differ from each other, and how to manipulate them to our liking.
